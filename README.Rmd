The goal of {scenes} is to make it easy to switch a {shiny} app between alternative 
UIs. 
It was designed to abstract the login-wrapper concept implemented in [{shinyslack}](https://github.com/r4ds/shinyslack).

## Installation

You can install the development version of scenes from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("r4ds/scenes")
```

## Use Cases

Add at least a short description here.

## Similar Packages

Other packages have implemented features in this domain.

-   [{brochure}](https://github.com/ColinFay/brochure): This package appears to have a great deal of overlap with {scenes}. Colin Fay's implementation appears to potentially be more robust and more complete than {scenes}, but at the cost of diverging farther from a "normal" shiny app.
-   [{shiny.router}](https://appsilon.com/shiny-router-020/): This package from [Appsilon](https://appsilon.com) appears to be conceptually similar to {scenes}, but focused on routing based on URL. Of the three packages listed here, this is the only one available on CRAN.
-   [{blaze}](https://github.com/nteetor/blaze): This package from Nate Teetor also focuses on routing based on URL. The resulting shiny apps are switched via the server function.
